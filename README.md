# Masters

# This repository is the code used for my masters thesis research

# In order to run this, the data is required
# Some instances require the appropriate environment in RStudio, some zip files have been included with a number of environments for each step
# Note that the data cannot be all stored within the same environment at a time depending on the memory on a given computer

# All the data is open sourced and can be gathered from EarthData.nasa.gov and USGS for Landsat-8 OLI data
# Some parameters might have to be changed depending on what is being done
# But these situations are commented throughout the code


# This code is mostly provided to show what I did and how I did it
